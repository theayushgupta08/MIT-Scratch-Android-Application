# MIT Scratch Clone in React Native

### Project Overview
This project is a mobile application that replicates the functionality of MIT Scratch, a platform designed to teach programming concepts through visual programming. The app allows users to create animations and interactive stories using sprites, blocks, and actions, making it an engaging way to learn coding for beginners and younger audiences.

### Features
1. Sprite Management: Users can select from a variety of sprites, each represented by an image. Sprites can be added to the playground at designated starting positions.
2. Action Blocks: Users can drag and drop action blocks to define the behavior of sprites, including movement and rotation.
3. Hero Feature: A special feature that allows for interactive sprite behavior, including collision detection and animation swapping.
4. Playground Area: A designated area where users can see their sprites in action based on the defined behaviors and actions.
5. Reset and Play Functions: Users can reset their playground or execute their defined actions to see how sprites interact based on the blocks they have added.

### Tech Stack
1. React Native: Framework for building the mobile application.
2. JavaScript: Programming language used for app logic and behavior.
3. Expo: Used for rapid development and testing of the React Native application.

### Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Start the app: npm start
